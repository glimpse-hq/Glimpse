0.9.4

### Features

- Onboarding is now a quick guided setup: tell Glimpse which language you dictate in and whether to prioritize quality, balance, or size, and it picks and downloads the right local model for you.
- New model browser for choosing local models: search by name, filter by category, and see each model's size and supported languages at a glance. Quantization options (Q5, Q8, Full) are grouped under each model so switching between them is simpler.

### Improvements

- Auto Dictionary now works with online transcription providers, not just local models.

### Fixes

- Fixed cancelling a dictation and immediately starting a new one occasionally pasting the cancelled text and glitching the recording pill.

- Glimpse CLI can now be pointed at any whisper models, it is no longer locked to Glimpse specific ones.

- More UI improvements.

### Fixes

- Fixed library error cards being hidden under other cards.
- Fixed website favicons not showing in Personalization.

0.9.0

### Features

- Glimpse Personal is here. Dictation is still free, but the more advanced stuff now has a one-time license so I can keep making this without exploding.

- Settings got reorganized into Core, Local, and Developer sections. Models is for speech models only; AI writing has its own Providers tab.

- Small redesign in personalization to look cleaner.
- Improved button rendering across the app for different view sizes.

### Fixes

- Fixed auto-delete forgetting whether you picked Audio or Transcripts when duration was set to Never, or after closing and reopening settings.
- Fixed the auto-delete dropdowns resizing and scrolling awkwardly when switching between Audio and Transcripts.
